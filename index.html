			<h1>Hi everyone, I'm Victor</h1>

			<p>
				Hello! My name is Victor and I am currently studying in IESEG School of Management in Lille. I am 18 years old and I have lived for multiple years abroad, in South East Asia, and more precisely, in Singapore and Malaysia.

			<h2>Surfing</h2>
			<p>
				I love surfing. Every summer in the south west of France I surf for 3 weeks, almost every day. This passion for this sport has taught me that sometimes, you cannot control what surrounds you. Moreover, it has taught me to adapt and overcome a certain type of situations.

			<h2>Travelling</h2>
			<p>
				Indeed, I love travelling abroad. This passion comes from the numerous experiences I have had in my past experience living abroad. This has brought me to discover new cultures. Additionally, I have learned to adapt to new cultures. I have not yet discovered the whole world, but I do intend to do it.

			<h2>Videogames</h2>
			<p>
				First thing first: videogames are amazing. People see videogames as a bad innovation because you tend to stay at home in front of your screen. However, I love videogames and I usually play online games. This allows me to escape reality in some kind of way. From another point of view, I usually meet online players who become good friends later on.
